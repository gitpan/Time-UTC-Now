version 0.007; 2009-03-24

  * bugfix: require bugfixed versions of Data::Float and Module::Runtime
    (for $SIG{__DIE__} handling)

  * use Win32 API GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() where available

  * when dealing with the BSD nanosecond-resolution ntp_gettime(),
    process the uncertainty bound with nanosecond resolution

  * document the origin of each API that the module attempts to use

  * separate code for different APIs into different C functions

  * use typemap to simplify handling of Boolean argument

  * much improved probe system

  * don't use ppport.h, because it wasn't doing anything for perl v5.6+

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * rearrange source tree to fit Module::Build convention

  * test POD syntax and coverage, and make a small style change in
    documentation to satisfy the coverage test

  * complete dependency list

  * include signature in distribution

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

version 0.006; 2007-02-05

  * add the utc_day_to_mjdn() function, duplicated from Time::UTC,
    for interoperability with other code that deals with UT days

  * when falling back on time(), add half a second onto its return value,
    because it rounds down

version 0.005; 2007-01-14

  * handle FreeBSD variations of ntp_gettime() interface: use of struct
    timespec instead of struct timeval; time may be returned with
    nanosecond precision instead of microsecond; leap state returned
    in time_state member of struct ntptimeval instead of return value
    of ntp_gettime()

  * in documentation, list OS-specific experiences (so far for Cygwin,
    FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris)

  * when performing configuration tests in Makefile.PL, display the
    content of the test as well as the compilation command line

version 0.004; 2006-08-05

  * in now_utc_flt(), allow for the rounding error in converting the
    uncertainty value to floating point, as well as the rounding error
    in converting the seconds value to floating point

  * in now_utc_flt(), when allowing for the rounding error in converting
    to floating point, use the actual parameters of the floating point
    type (from Data::Float) instead of assuming IEEE 754 double

  * use "=> 0" instead of "=> undef" in unversioned dependencies in
    Makefile.PL

version 0.003; 2006-06-29

  * use ntp_gettime() in addition to ntp_adjtime() on systems where
    struct timex does not include the `time' member (the current time):
    this situation has been seen on FreeBSD 5.4 and Solaris 10, and
    prevented compilation of the previous version

  * zero out entire timex structure before ntp_adjtime(), not just the
    `modes' member, for the benefit of systems that check validity of
    unused control variables: this problem caused fallback to
    gettimeofday() on affected systems

  * include XSLoader in dependency list in Makefile.PL

  * various documentation clarifications

  * discuss overflow of day number for now_utc_sna()

  * add Time::TAI::Now to "see also" list

version 0.002; 2006-05-19

  * add the utc_day_to_cjdn() function, duplicated from Time::UTC, to
    avoid the need to use that module in order to process the output of
    this one

  * documentation tweaks for clarity

version 0.001; 2006-05-17

  * bugfix: Unix epoch was wrong in the code, making all returned values
    a day out

version 0.000; 2006-05-16

  * initial released version
