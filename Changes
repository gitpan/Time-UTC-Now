version 0.004; 2006-08-05

  * in now_utc_flt(), allow for the rounding error in converting the
    uncertainty value to floating point, as well as the rounding error
    in converting the seconds value to floating point

  * in now_utc_flt(), when allowing for the rounding error in converting
    to floating point, use the actual parameters of the floating point
    type (from Data::Float) instead of assuming IEEE 754 double

  * use "=> 0" instead of "=> undef" in unversioned dependencies in
    Makefile.PL

version 0.003; 2006-06-29

  * use ntp_gettime() in addition to ntp_adjtime() on systems where
    struct timex does not include the `time' member (the current time):
    this situation has been seen on FreeBSD 5.4 and Solaris 10, and
    prevented compilation of the previous version

  * zero out entire timex structure before ntp_adjtime(), not just the
    `modes' member, for the benefit of systems that check validity of
    unused control variables: this problem caused fallback to
    gettimeofday() on affected systems

  * include XSLoader in dependency list in Makefile.PL

  * various documentation clarifications

  * discuss overflow of day number for now_utc_sna()

  * add Time::TAI::Now to "see also" list

version 0.002; 2006-05-19

  * add the utc_day_to_cjdn() function, duplicated from Time::UTC, to
    avoid the need to use that module in order to process the output of
    this one

  * documentation tweaks for clarity

version 0.001; 2006-05-17

  * bugfix: Unix epoch was wrong in the code, making all returned values
    a day out

version 0.000; 2006-05-16

  * initial released version
