NAME

Time::UTC::Now - determine current time in UTC correctly

DESCRIPTION

This module is one answer to the question "what time is it?".
It determines the current time on the UTC scale, handling leap seconds
correctly, and puts a bound on how inaccurate it could be.  It is the
rigorously correct approach to determining civil time.  It is designed
to interoperate with Time::UTC, which knows all about the UTC time scale.

INSTALLATION
